# Strike off

Strike off is a progressive web app using Web Components & Indexed DB.

Key features :

- Fast
- Simple
- Keyboard accessible
- Screenreader supported (Work in progress)
- Locally stored with no sync

Strike off uses StencilJS, which combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.
Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.
